# BeerApp-Final

Team: Kay Lin, Marya Smirnova

Summary: We created a Beer App based on an existing website, http://staugustinesvancouver.com/.
We used stayed with the brand identity of the bar, and focused on improving the live beer menu they offer.
By simplifying the menu and created a convinient way to sort through beers.
We implemented a favorite/like function however only now we realized that we are missing 
a cookies/local storage component. Idealy we would want the favorite beers to stay when refreshed.

Comments: It was a challenging first project since both of us are not familiar with making apps. We learned a lot
and wished we understood somethings sooner (it was very confusing at first).
